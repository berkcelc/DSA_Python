Creating a node class that has next and previous values
Creating a double linked list that initiates with blank node and 
then creating methods for addition of data and addition of nodes

while creating the first node 
we define the node and assign the head and the tail to the same node'

while appending the element to the linked list we check if the head is None

create a new node
else we go to the tail and we add the element there and add the node there


reversing a complete linked list
