basically for code reusability

Attributes are basically variables that are associated with objects
Methods are functions that are associated with objects 

All objects have

    1. Identity
    2. Attributes
    3. Behaviors

A class is a detailed representation of what an object will be but it is not itseld an object.



A block of code or program procedure that can be called to perform some actions and it may return a value

Methods are defined as part of class

the attributes are declared as part of the class, which are decalred at the time of creation of objects

The important part of creating a new object is Initializer,
    
    
    in python we can do it by __init__ method.
    def __init__(self):          # noramallyu used to initialize the attributes
        # initialize attributes

There are two attributes, class attributes and object attributes.

The class attributes are shared by all the objects created by using the class
The object attributes belong only to the perticular object.

If we change the class attributes we will also be changeing the object attributes simultaneously.
But if we change the object attributes that belong to the class, we wont be able to change it by changing class attributes

methods are the Behaviors of the object.
