Getting an element from the array

element = array[index]


# Search for an element in the array
1. Linear search

Time complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)

# Deleting an element from the array
After deletion of an element from the array, the subsequent element will be moved one left

Time complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)


### Working with multidimentional arrays

We cannot Add single element , we need to ad either a row or a column

Adding a column - Time complexity - O(mn)
Adding a row - Time complexity - O(nm)
