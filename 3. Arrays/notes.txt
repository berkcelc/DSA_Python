Getting an element from the array

element = array[index]


# Search for an element in the array
1. Linear search

Time complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)

# Deleting an element from the array
After deletion of an element from the array, the subsequent element will be moved one left

Time complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)


### Working with multidimentional arrays

We cannot Add single element , we need to ad either a row or a column

Adding a column - Time complexity - O(mn)
Adding a row - Time complexity - O(nm)

Space Complexity for addition row/ column - O(mn)


### deletion of a column or a row
for deletion we select the column that is required and similar for the row

Time complexity - O(mn)
Space complexity - O(nm)


When to use and avoid using array

for variables of different data types
Array reserves a memory in the memory pool which affects the performance 
of the application
