def __iter__(self):: Defines a method called __iter__ which makes an object iterable. 
Python calls the object's __iter__ method when a for-loop is used with the object.

node = self.head: Initializes a variable node to be the head of the list, which is the starting point for iteration.

yield node: Uses the yield keyword to define a generator. yield produces a value and suspends the functionâ€™s execution.
 The function can then be resumed from where it left off, thus allowing it to produce a series of values over time.


The circular linked List has a break point once it reaches to the head.

The time and space complexity of creation of a new csll - O(1)
Space Complexity - O(1)



Working with csll

1. Adding an element to the csll at different position



Methods of deletion of csll 

1. Deletion of first node
2. Deletion of a given node
3. Deletion of last node

To delete all the elements of csll, we need to change three references
self.head = None
self.tail.next = None
self.tail = None
