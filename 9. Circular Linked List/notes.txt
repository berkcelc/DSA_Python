def __iter__(self):: Defines a method called __iter__ which makes an object iterable. 
Python calls the object's __iter__ method when a for-loop is used with the object.

node = self.head: Initializes a variable node to be the head of the list, which is the starting point for iteration.

yield node: Uses the yield keyword to define a generator. yield produces a value and suspends the functionâ€™s execution.
 The function can then be resumed from where it left off, thus allowing it to produce a series of values over time.
