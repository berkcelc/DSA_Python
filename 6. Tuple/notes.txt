When we create a single element tuple, we need to put a , at the end

Tuples in memory

we cannot modify the element in the tuple as they are immutable

Traversing Time Complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)

Tuple Operation

- we generally use tuples for heterogeneous data types and lists for homogeneous data types
iterating over the tuple is faster than iterating over lists
Tuples can be used as a key for dictionaries
